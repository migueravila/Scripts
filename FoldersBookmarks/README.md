# Folders Bookmarks

> #### Command name: `bmkm`
>
> #### Developer: [Repo](https://github.com/sumnerevans/menu-calc)

### 📄 Usage:

When you run the script you'll have to choose one option to open the file manager in that specific folder.

### ⚙️ Installation:

Every script has It's own makefile. In the directory of the script you want to install, run `sudo make install` and It'll be installed in your `$PATH`.

You have to change the script to the folders you want to bookmark. Also you have to change the app you want to open your folders. (I use pcmanfm, but you can replace that part with thunar or nautilus...)
